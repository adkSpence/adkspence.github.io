title: Waltzing Through Vienna - 3-Day Sojourn

Home they brought her warrior dead:  
She nor swooned, nor uttered cry:  
All her maidens, watching, said,  
'She must weep or she will die.'  

Then they praised him, soft and low,  
Called him worthy to be loved,  
Truest friend and noblest foe;  
Yet she neither spoke nor moved.
