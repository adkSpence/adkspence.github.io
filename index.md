Embarking on a Master's in Artificial Intelligence Engineering has been a fulfilling and exciting journey in my life. My passion for AI and Software Engineering was sparked by the ingenuity of [Liftware](https://www.liftware.com/){:target="_blank"}, (an electronic stabilizing spoon that helps persons with Parkinson's disease eat with confidence), when during my 1st year of Undergrad studies at [Ghana Communication Technology University](https://site.gctu.edu.gh/){:target="_blank"} I had to do a research assignment on using Technology in Healthcare.  My journey is not just about technological innovation but also about contributing my quota in making the world a better place.
