Embarking on a Master's in Artificial Intelligence Engineering as a [DAAD Leadership for Africa](https://www.daad.de/en/the-daad/what-we-do/sustainable-development/funding-programmes/funding-programmes-for-students-a-z/leadership-for-africa/){:target="_blank"} has been a fulfilling and exciting journey in my life. My passion for AI and Software Engineering was sparked by the ingenuity of [Liftware](https://www.liftware.com/){:target="_blank"} in helping persons with Parkinson's disease eat with confidence during my Information Technology undergradate at [Ghana Communication Technology University](https://site.gctu.edu.gh/){:target="_blank"}.This journey is not just about technological innovation but also about contributing my quota in making the world a better place.
